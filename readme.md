<h2 aling="center" > Description</h2>

The Mangalavye is an **RFID Based Restaurant Food Ordering System** ,initially made for 24 hour hackathon at  SRM University 
- It is a web-based system that generates a token using RFID technology.
- The token is transferred to the user, and a 3D model-based ordering system is shown to them.
- The project is based on a Utopian theme inspired by Elon Musk's vision of life on Mars in 2050.- 
- The system eliminates the need for waiters in the restaurant.
- The aim is to provide an innovative and futuristic dining experience to customers.

### Configuration

- `Present a handy module consisting of RFID reader and microsystems which are used to generate tokens for customer..
- 'The token is then transferred to user following with a 3d view of all the menu options.

## Getting Started

   ### Deployment
- To run this project, install it locally and you'll need hardware support(Arduino) for this you'll need sensors too.
- You can deploy the site for menu from the specific folder. It is made for:)
     

- For help getting started with IOT development, view the [online documentation](https://www.internetsociety.org/iot/), which offers help on IOT development, and a full API reference.
