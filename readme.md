The Mangalavye is an **RFID Based Restaurant Food Ordering System** ,initially made for 24 hour hackathon at  SRM University 
- It is a web-based system that generates a token using RFID technology.
- The token is transferred to the user, and a 3D model-based ordering system is shown to them.
- The project is based on a Utopian theme inspired by Elon Musk's vision of life on Mars in 2050.-
